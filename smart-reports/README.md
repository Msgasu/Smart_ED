- `courses` - Course definitions
- `student_courses` - Student-course assignments  
- `faculty_courses` - Teacher-course assignments
- `student_reports` - Report cards by term
- `student_grades` - Individual subject grades
- `notifications` - Communication system

## Setup Instructions

1. **Copy Supabase Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the supabase config from main Smart_ED
   cp ../src/lib/supabase.js src/lib/supabase.js
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Update Supabase Config**:
   Edit `src/lib/supabase.js` with your actual Supabase URL and keys (same as main Smart_ED).

4. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The system will run on `http://localhost:3001` (different port from main Smart_ED).
